            I am an individual with high levels of motivation and professionalism. Leaving my comfort zone is something that I feel is a challenge to me and I am always one to overcome challenges that I am faced with. In order to do this I will devise suitable solutions
            by thinking creatively and widely, as well as considering all factors to ensure that the challenge is overcome correctly and efficiently. I will always set myself new goals in order to better myself as an individual.

            Whilst working at The Heathland School (Jun 2016 - September 2016) I had been working alongside the Network Department. From this I gained vital knowledge and skills such as binary calculation and the foundations of network management. I had also undergone
            training in IT support as well as network support. Throughout this working period I also began to install servers as well as re-imaging clients to the central server.
