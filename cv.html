            I am an individual with high levels of motivation and professionalism. Leaving my comfort zone is something that I feel is a challenge to me and I am always one to overcome challenges that I am faced with. In order to do this I will devise suitable solutions
            by thinking creatively and widely, as well as considering all factors to ensure that the challenge is overcome correctly and efficiently. I will always set myself new goals in order to better myself as an individual.
